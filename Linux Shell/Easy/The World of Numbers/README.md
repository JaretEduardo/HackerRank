# The World of Numbers

Given two integers, x and y, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

#### Input Format

Two lines containing one integer each (x and y, respectively). 

#### Constrains

-100 < x, y < 100
y not= 0

#### Output Format

Four lines containing the sum (x + y), difference (x - y), product (x * y), and quotient (x / y), respectively.
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)

#### Sample Input

```md
5
2
```

#### Sample Output

```md
7
3
10
2
```

#### Explanation

5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2 (Integer part)
